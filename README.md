#tools
1. bombremove: clear up the ruins and shrapnel after carpet bombardment
2. dpinolib: deploy arduino lib sounds fancy, just copy a dir(or remove it)
3. upshellconfig: always keep a nice shell config
4. initinolib: auto generate Arduino Library code
...(Huge PIA here, in order to test the lib, surely an INO file is needed, however, if this INO file is named the same as the library file, it won't compile, it just won't fxxx compile )
5. initweb: helps me generate all the web related annoying stuffs
